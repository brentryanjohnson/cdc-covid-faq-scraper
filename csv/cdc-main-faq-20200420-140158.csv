Question,Answer
What is a novel coronavirus?,"<div><p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html"">coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold.</p>
<p>A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.</p></div>"
"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","<div><p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization <a href=""https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1227297754499764230"">announced</a> an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.</p>
<p>There are <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"">many types</a> of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=""https://www.who.int/topics/infectious_diseases/naming-new-diseases/en/"">best practice<span>external icon</span><span>external icon</span><span></span></a> for naming of new human infectious diseases.</p></div>"
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"<div><p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.</p>
<p>Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.</p></div>"
How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,"<div><p>People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/reducing-stigma.html"">mental health</a> of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/coping.html"">resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19</a>. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html"">knowing the facts</a> and sharing them with others in your community.</p></div>"
Why do some state’s COVID-19 case numbers sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website?,<div><p>CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.</p></div>
How do CDC’s COVID-19 case numbers compare with those provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Johns Hopkins?,"<div><p>CDC’s COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.</p></div>"
Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?,"<div><p>Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as “backfill.”) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.</p></div>"
What is the source of the virus?,"<div><p>COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html"">MERS-CoV</a> and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html"">SARS-CoV</a>, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html#emergence"">Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus</a>.</p></div>"
How does the virus spread?,"<div><p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</p>
<p>COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"">many affected geographic areas</a>. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>
<p>Learn what is known about the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html"">spread of newly emerged coronaviruses</a>.</p></div>"
Why are we seeing a rise in cases?,"<div><p>The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html"">number of cases of COVID-19</a> being reported in the United States is rising due to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html"">increased laboratory testing</a> and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.</p></div>"
Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"<div><p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"">spreading from person-to-person</a>. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.</p>
<p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html"">CDC’s guidance on when to release someone from isolation</a> and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html"">Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.</p></div>"
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"<div><p>Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.</p></div>"
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?","<div><p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
<p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.</p>
<p>Learn what is known about the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html"">spread of COVID-19</a>.</p></div>"
Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?,"<div><p>Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.</p></div>"
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"<div><p>It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</p></div>"
What is community spread?,"<div><p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p></div>"
What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?,"<div><p>Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/disinfecting-your-home.html"">CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection</a>.</p></div>"
Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"<div><p>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"">How Coronavirus Spreads</a> for more information.</p></div>"

What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"<div><p>There is information for <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html"">people who have had close contact</a> with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.</p></div>"
Does CDC recommend the use of facemask or face coverings to prevent COVID-19?,"<div><p>In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html"">cloth face covering</a> to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example). Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p></div>"
Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?,"<div><p>There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. This coronaviruses is thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html"">Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website</a> as it becomes available.</p></div>"
Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"<div><p>In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.</p></div>"
Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?,"<div><p></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.</li>
<li>Contact lens wearers should continue to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/protect-your-eyes.html"">practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits</a> to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses.</li>

What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"<div><p>Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html"">People who are at higher risk for severe illness</a>.</p></div>"
How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?,"<div><p>You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.</li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.</li>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).</li>
<li>Launder items, including washable plush toys, as appropriate and in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.</li>

Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"<div><p>No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.</p></div>"
Should children wear masks?,"<div><p>CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.</p>
<p>Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p></div>"
How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?,"<div><p>Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html"">Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults</a>. CDC offers <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/talking-with-children.html"">resources</a> to help talk with children about COVID-19.</p></div>"
What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?,"<div><p>This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However, children do get the virus and become ill. Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.</p>
<p>If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.</p>
<p>Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.</p></div>"
"While school’s out, can my child hang out with their friends?","<div><p></p>
<ul>
<li>The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.</li>
<li>To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.</li>
<li>Make sure children practice <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">everyday preventive behaviors</a>, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.
<ul>
<li>Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information about <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"">COVID-19 in children</a> is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may have only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html"">older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions</a>.</li>

"While school’s out, how can I help my child continue learning?","<div><p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay in touch with your child’s school.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.</li>
<li>Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Have consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.</li>
<li>Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.</li>
<li>Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.</li>
<li>Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Look for ways to make learning fun.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.</li>
<li>Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.</li>
<li>Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.</li>
<li>Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.</li>
<li>Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions are part of <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">everyday preventive actions</a> individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
<li>When washing hands, you can use plain soap or antibacterial soap. Plain soap is as effective as antibacterial soap at removing germs.</li>

You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.</li>
</ul>
<p>CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/136118/download"">products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredients<span>external icon</span><span>external icon</span><span></span></a> and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.

<ul>
<li>To be effective against killing some types of germs, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html"">hand sanitizers </a>need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy.</li>

</ul>
<p></p></div>"
Should I go to work if there is an outbreak in my community?,"<div><p>Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.</p></div>"
Will businesses and schools close or stay closed in my community and for how long? Will there be a “stay at home” or “shelter in place” order in my community?,"<div><p>Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can.

Can CDC tell me or my employer when it is safe for me to go back to work/school after recovering from or being exposed to COVID-19?,"<div><p>CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses. CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities. These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  “stay at home” or “shelter in place.” What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities. These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.</p>
<p>Please <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/accreditation/departments.html"">contact your local health department</a> to find out more.</p></div>"
What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?,"<div><p>CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.</p>
<p>If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you. Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.</p>
<p>CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html</a>.</p>

Where can I get tested for COVID-19?,"<div><p>Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. For information about testing, see <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html"">Testing for COVID-19</a>.</p></div>"
Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?,"<div><p>The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. See <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html"">Testing for COVID-19</a> for more information.</p></div>"
What kind of test is being used to diagnose if I have COVID-19?,"<div><p>Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.</p>
<p>For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.</p></div>"
What is serology testing? And can I be tested using this method?,"<div><p>Many tests to diagnose COVID-19 have received an <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations"">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)<span>external icon</span><span></span></a> from the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasopharyngeal swabs.</p>
<p>Locations and types of testing sites may vary by state or territory (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. You can find a <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd"">patient information sheet for each test<span>external icon</span><span></span></a> on the FDA site.</p>
<p>Be aware that at this time, no home tests have been authorized for use. All tests must be done at a testing site. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding testing that may include home collection, and they are actively working with test developers on this goal.</p></div>"
"If I have recovered from COVID-19, will I be immune to it?","<div><p>Serology testing checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.</p>
<p>CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers. This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.</p>
<p>We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone. Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.</p>
<p>Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.</p></div>"
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"<div><p>CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.</p></div>"
What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?,"<div><p>COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, <strong>older adults</strong> and <strong>people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions</strong> might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html"">People aged 65 years and older</a></li>
<li>People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>

<ul>
<li>People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma</li>
<li>People who have serious heart conditions</li>
<li>People who are immunocompromised
<ul>
<li>Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40)</li>
<li>People with diabetes</li>
<li>People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis</li>
<li>People with liver disease</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>"
How were the underlying conditions for people considered higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 selected?,"<div><p>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock up on supplies</li>
<li>Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others</li>
<li>When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick</li>
<li>Limit close contact and wash your hands often</li>
<li>Avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html"">People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.</a></p></div>"
Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19?,"<div><p>This list is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What we are learning from the outbreak in other countries and in the United States.</li>
<li>What we know about risk from other respiratory infections, like flu.</li>
</ul>
<p>As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.</p></div>"
What about underlying medical conditions that are not included on this list?,"<div><p></p>
<p>Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.</p>
<p>People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.</p>
<p></p></div>"
What does a well-controlled health condition mean?,"<div><p>Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.</p>
<p>We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html"">steps</a> to protect yourself and others.</li>

<li>Follow CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html"">travel</a> guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>"
What does more severe illness mean?,"<div><p>Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.</p></div>"
Are people with disabilities at higher risk?,<div><p>Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body’s function.  You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.</p></div>
What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?,"<div><p>Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.</li>
</ul>

Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?,<div><p>There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.</p></div>
What do funeral home workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19?,"<div><p>COVID-19 is a new disease and <strong>we are still learning how it spreads.</strong> The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.</p>
<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
<p>People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).</p>
<p>Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/sars-cov-2-list_03-03-2020.pdf"">Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims<span>pdf icon</span><span>external icon</span><span>pdf icon</span><span></span><span></span><span>external icon</span><span></span></a> are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas?,"<div><p>A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/standard-precautions.html"">Standard Precautions</a>, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/sars-cov-2-list_03-03-2020.pdf"">product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims<span>pdf icon</span><span>external icon</span><span>pdf icon</span><span></span><span></span><span>external icon</span><span></span></a> expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.</p>
<p>Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem-specimens.html#autopsy"">CDC’s Postmortem Guidance</a>.

My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the United States?,"<div><p>When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the <a href=""https://www.usembassy.gov/"">US embassy<span>external icon</span><span>external icon</span><span>external icon</span><span></span></a> closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.</p></div>"
What is CDC doing about COVID-19?,"<div><p>CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.</p>
<p>CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html"">quarantinable communicable disease</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remains are cremated; OR</li>
<li>The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a hermetically sealed casket; OR</li>
<li>The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.
<ul>
<li>Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing <a href=""mailto:dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov"">dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov</a>.</li>

Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?,"<div><p>CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect people’s health. More information about <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html#cdc-response"">CDC’s response to COVID-19</a> is available online.</p></div>"
Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19?,"<div><p>At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection in the United States. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/stay-healthy-pets.html"">healthy habits</a> around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/index.html"">Healthy Pets, Healthy People website</a>.</p></div>"
Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"<div><p>No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.</p></div>"
Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?,"<div><p>Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.</p>
<p>However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/stay-healthy-pets.html"">healthy habits</a> around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.</p></div>"
What animals can get COVID-19?,"<div><p>You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.</p></div>"
"Since tigers can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, should I worry about my pet cat?","<div><p>We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, outside the United States reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based off a small number of animals, and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.</p>
<p>CDC has not received any reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States. To date, there is no evidence that pets can spread the virus to people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals may be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19.</p></div>"
Can I walk my dog?,"<div><p>The tiger infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 is the first case of its kind. We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a very small number of pets outside the United States, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.</p>
<p>To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets, including cats, becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, can spread COVID-19 to people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.</p>
<p>People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.</p></div>"
What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19?,"<div><p>Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being. Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings. Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk. </p></div>"
Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested?,"<div><p>There is a very small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after having contact with a person with a COVID-19 infection. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.</p>
<p>If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, <strong>do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself</strong>. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other alternate plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.</p></div>"
Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt?,"<div><p>Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.</p></div>"
What about imported animals or animal products?,"<div><p>There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, in the United States, might be a source of COVID-19.</p></div>"
Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"<div><p>CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.</p>
